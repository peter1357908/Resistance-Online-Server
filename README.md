# Online Multiplayer Game API

![Team Photo](https://i.imgur.com/FAXdtY4.jpg)

We will be building an online version of the popular game, Resistance. The game will be free-to-play with no sign-ups required!

TODO: short project description, some sample screenshots or mockups

## Architecture

We plan on organizing our project similarly to how we've implemented the blog project we built in lab 3.

Backend (host on Heroku):
* Sockets
* Express
* Mongo

Frontend (host on Surge):
* Webpack (to bundle everything together)
* React
* CSS

We will also use p5.js and mo.js to support some simple graphics / animations and UI!

## Setup

We'll use yarn to manage our packages, like we've been doing in the labs. So, install all the dependencies with: `yarn install`

## Deployment

We'll deploy to the front-end surge, as we've been doing for the labs. As mentioned already, the back-end will be hosted on Firebase.

SHOUT OUT TO TIM!!!

We'd also like to thank all developers of crappy online Resistence games, who inspired us to make something better.
